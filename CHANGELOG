SIRE changelog
==============

devel branch:

    [2016.3.0] December 22 2016 - Public release containing full LigandSwap. Uses
     new optimised forcefields for energy calculations, built on top of Intel Threaded
     Building Blocks for parallelisation. New code is significantly faster with better
     scaling.

    [2016.2.0] June 3 2016 - Semi-private release for the CCP-BioSim workshops. Included
     the first version of LigandSwap and general bug fixes

    [2016.1.0] April 29 2016 - Merge of Bristol and Edinburgh codes, moved to miniconda
     and clean packaging system, including OpenMM fully, added in nautilus, somd etc.,
     added optimised forcefields, added a proper unit testing suite.


    [OLD] Updated gradient compuation in openmmfreenergst to finite differece gradients
    Allow the computation of reduced perturbed energies in openmmfreenergst of all computed lambda values
    Separated minimization and equilibration from production run.
    Implemented mass repartitioning for hydrogens atoms to allow for larger integration timesteps
    Added nautilus scripts
